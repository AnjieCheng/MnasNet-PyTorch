# Overview
A PyTorch implementation of Mnasnet searched architecture: [MnasNet: Platform-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Mobile](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11626). On the ImageNet classification task, the model achieves 74.0% top-1 accuracy with 76ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.5Ã— faster than MobileNetV2
